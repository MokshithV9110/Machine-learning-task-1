his project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize hand gestures from images, enabling intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems.

## Dataset

The dataset should contain images of different hand gestures, organized into separate folders for each gesture. For example:
Each folder contains images representing the corresponding gesture. All images are resized to 64x64 pixels and converted to grayscale during preprocessing.

## Requirements

•⁠  ⁠Python 3.x
•⁠  ⁠Libraries: ⁠ numpy ⁠, ⁠ pandas ⁠, ⁠ opencv-python ⁠, ⁠ keras ⁠, ⁠ tensorflow ⁠, ⁠ scikit-learn ⁠, ⁠ matplotlib ⁠

Install the dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas opencv-python scikit-learn keras tensorflow matplotlib
